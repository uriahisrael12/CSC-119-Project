## Problem
A program that will provide text either from the Bible or URL links containing information pertaining to relational/civil advice between people of the black community.

In the black community, there are too many instances of problems involving the households and environments of black children: ”Baby Mama/Daddy” Drama, Divorce, Single parent households, murder, thievary, drug abuse, etc... We need to come to terms with this issue and realize that we have not applied the solution to the problem.

## Solution
My solution for this problem is to inform about what the scriptures in the Bible say concerning marriage and relationships, considering the fact that approximately 80% of the ’black’ community profess themselves as Christians.
